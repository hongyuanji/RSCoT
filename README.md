# RSCoT: A Rich Semantic Chain-of-Thought for Remote Sensing VQA Based on Module Analysis and Model Collaboration
We propose RSCoT, a modular instruction-based query refinement framework which features a dynamic selector and decision generation architecture that effectively integrates context and CoT reasoning strategy for RSVQA task resolution.
